# dine-o
Text-based service to help groups of people pick a restaurant. The goal is maximum satisfaction!

Dine-o will use the Twilio REST API to communicate with a group of users in order to find the best Ann Arbor restaurant at which to eat. Din-o is being developed at MHacks Spring 2017 in python.
